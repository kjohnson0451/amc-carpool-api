- In my update controllers, I'm calling both get and update services. It's a little slow. Is that OK?
- Am I cleanly handling errors in the contollers?
- Root owned files. Sometimes, node_modules/.cache/@babel/register/.babel.7.23.0.development.json is root owned
- babel-plugin-module-resolver is an archived repo
- ESLint won't reconcile with babel-plugin-module-resolver


COMMENTS FROM SAM
- Use a local db for development
- Use a more appropriate datatype for coordinates. Try geolocation stuff for postgres
